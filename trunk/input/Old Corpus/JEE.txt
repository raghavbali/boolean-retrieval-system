The Indian Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examination (abbreviated IIT-JEE or simply JEE) is an annual college entrance examination in India. It is used as the sole admission criterion by the sixteen Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The examination is organised each year by one of the various IITs, using a round robin rotation pattern. It has a very low admission rate (about 1 in 50 in 2011) and is considered the toughest exam in India after the UPSC's Engineering Services Examination which determines entry into the elite Indian Engineering Services.

From 2013, IITJEE will be clubbed with AIEEE an Engineering Entrance Examination for NITs. Further more IITJEE will be held in two phases, Phase 1 will be called as JEE Main and the second stage of the test will be JEE Advanced.[1] Apart from the NITs, IIITs & IITs, the Indian Institute of Space and Technology has also announced that it will select students based on JEE Main.[2]

History

The JEE was conducted for the first time in 1960,[3][4] when it had four subjects including an English language paper. The examination has since evolved considerably from its initial pattern. The JEE was initially called as the Common Entrance Exam (CEE). The CEE coincides with the IIT Act of 1961, to later named as JEE.[5]

In 1997, the JEE was conducted twice after the question paper was leaked in some centers.

Between 2000 and 2005, an additional screening test was used alongside the main examination, intended to reduce pressure on the main examination by allowing only about 20,000 top candidates to sit the paper, out of more than 450,000 applicants.

In September 2005, an analysis group of directors of all the IITs announced major reforms to the examination. These were implemented from 2006 onwards. The revised test now consists of a single objective test, replacing the earlier two-test system. In order to be eligible for the main examination, candidates in the general category must secure a minimum of 60% aggregated marks in the qualifying examination of the XIIth standard organized by various educational boards of India, while candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Physically Disabled (PD) categories must secure a minimum of 55%.

In 2008, the Director and the Dean of IIT Madras called for revisions to the examination, arguing that the coaching institutes were "enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying". They expressed concern that the present system did not allow for applicants' 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IITs.[6]

In 2008, the Indian Institutes of Technology, for the first time, went overseas with their entrance examination as they set up a centre for the competitive test in Dubai.[7] The number of candidates appearing in Dubai hovered around 200 to 220.[8]

In 2012, IIT JEE was conducted on 8 April, for which over 520,000 students had appeared for about 10,000 engineering seats across India.[9] Result of JEE 2012 with All India Ranks (AIRs) has been declared on 18 May 2012.[10]
Procedure to select students for JEE Advanced 2013

IITs have announced the procedure they will adopt to select candidates for JEE Advanced. 150,000 candidates will be selected for JEE Advanced, 50.5% of the 1,50,000 (75,750 candidates) will be taken from the top rankers of the Common Merit List (CML) of JEE (Main). 27% (40,500), 15% (22,500) and 7.5% (11,250) candidates will be taken from the top rankers of the category rank lists of OBC-NCL, SC and ST, respectively. The candidates figuring in the category rank lists will be those who do not figure in the 75,750 candidates chosen from the CML.[11]
Seats and attendance

The number of students taking the examination has increased substantially each year with over 485,000 showing up for IIT-JEE 2011. This represented an increase of 30,000 students (6.5%) from 2010.[12]

From 2008, six new IITs have been opened with 120 seats each, increasing the total number of seats to almost 7000. For 2009, admissions have been made to two more IITs, namely IIT Indore and IIT Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) taking the seat count to almost 8300. As of 2011, with additional courses in several old and new IITs, the total seat count has crossed 9600.
Eligibility

The age limit for sitting the JEE is 25 years. For candidates belonging to SC, ST and PD categories, the relaxed age limit is 30 years.

Also, since 2007, candidates have been allowed to take the JEE a maximum of two times. This change was intended to reduce stress on applicants, and to discourage the concept of 'cram schools'. Also since 2007, students selected for admission to an IIT and paid the accepting fee, cannot attempt the examination again in the future.
New Admission Norms for IIT

The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Union government have finally agreed to the new format of IIT entrance examination as suggested by the Joint Admission Board (JAB). The new format of exams will be implemented from 2013.

Joint Admission Board (JAB) of IIT Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced)- 2013 met on August 27, 2012 at IIT Delhi to discuss the forthcoming admission. The admission to the undergraduate programmes at the 16 IITs and ISMU, Dhanbad for the year 2013 will be based on a two-tier test. The first test called the JEE (Main), will be held during the month of April, 2013 (both offline and online). This test will be conducted by CBSE. The second test, called the JEE (Advanced), will be held on June 2, 2013 (only offline). Only 1,50,000 of the top rankers in JEE(Main), which includes students from all categories( GE,OBC(NCL), SC and ST ) will be eligible to appear in JEE(Advanced).

The JEE (Advanced)- 2013 will have two objective type papers. Each paper will consist of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Duration of each paper will be 3-hours. Question papers will be in both English and Hindi. Admissions to IITs will be based only on category wise All India Rank (AIR) in JEE(Advanced) subject to the condition that such candidates are in the top 20 percentile of successful candidates of their Boards in applicable categories.[15]

According to RK Shevgaonkar, director, IIT-Delhi, the aim of the new format is to make students perform well in their board exams without neglecting it and not get influenced by the coaching classes offering tutorials for IIT-JEE.
Criticism

Criticism on the New Admission Norms comes from the Super 30 founder and mathematician Anand Kumar. Anand Kumar on Wednesday said that the decision of the IIT Council to give chance to students having top 20% from various boards in the class 12 examinations, was a decision in haste. "This is one decision that will go against the poor, who don't have the opportunity to study in elite schools," he added.[16]

Under the new format, an advance test would be conducted and the elite educational institutions would admit students having top 20 percent from school boards. Another criticism is about the language of the exam. IIT-JEE is conducted only in English and Hindi, making it harder for students where regional languages, like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu, Oriya, Bengali, Marathi, Assamese or Gujarati, are more prominent. As an example, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court has acted on a Public Interest Litigation by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad, for conducting the exams in Gujarati.[17] A second petition was made in October by Navsari's Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Pustakalaya Trust.[18] Another petition was made at the Madras High Court for conducting the exam in Tamil. In the petition it was claimed that not conducting the exam in the regional languages is in violation of article 14 of the Constitution of India. PMK, political party in Tamil Nadu holds a demonstration at Chennai for conducting IIT and other national entrance exams in regional languages also, particularly Tamil in Tamil Nadu.[19] Pattali Makkal Katchi party has filed Public Interest Litigation in Madras High Court for conducting IIT JEE entrance exam in Tamil also. They submitted that every year 7.63 lakh students are completing 12th standard in Tamil Nadu. Out of them 75% are from Tamil Medium. They are forced to appear for the entrance exam in English or Hindi which is neither their medium of instruction nor mother tongue. Being forced as such is against their fundamental right to take up the entrance exam in mother-tongue-based medium of instruction.[20][21]Shiv Sena has urged MHRD to conduct IITJEE and other national undergraduate entrance exams in regional languages, particularly Marathi language in Maharastra.[22]
