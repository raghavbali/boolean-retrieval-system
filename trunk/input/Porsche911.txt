The Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or German: Neunelfer) is the flagship of the current line up of Porsche. It is a two-door grand tourer made by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a distinctive design, rear-engined and with independent rear suspension, an evolution of the swing axle on the Porsche 356. Since its introduction in 1963,[1] it has undergone continuous development, though the basic concept has remained little changed.[2] The engine was air-cooled until the introduction of the Type 996 in 1998.
