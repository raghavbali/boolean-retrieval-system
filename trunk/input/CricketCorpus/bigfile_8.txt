Yuvraj Singh About this sound pronunciation (help·info) (Punjabi: ਯੁਵਰਾਜ ਸਿੰਘ) (born 12 December 1981) is an Indian cricketer, and the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi movie star Yograj Singh.[1] Yuvraj is a left-hand middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox bowler. He has been a member of the Indian cricket team in ODIs since 2000 and played his first Test match in 2003. He was the vice-captain of the ODI team from late-2007 to late-2008. At the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six sixes in an over against England's Stuart Broad — a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and previously never in an international match between two Test cricket nations. He was named the Man of the Tournament in the 2011 Cricket World Cup and was one of the top performers at the 2007 World Twenty20, both of which India won.

In 2011, he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor (stage-I) in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment at the Cancer Research Institute in Boston, USA as well as Medicine Facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana.[2][3] In March 2012, Yuvraj was discharged from hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April.[4][5] He was conferred with Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting award in the year 2012 by the President Pranab Mukherjee.[6] He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.

Early years and personal life

Yuvraj Singh belongs to a Sikh Jat family; his parents are Yograj Singh and Shabnam Singh.[7][8][9][10][11] After his parents divorced, Yuvraj chose to stay with his mother.[12] Tennis and roller skating were among Yuvraj favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both. He won the National U-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket.[13] He would take Yuvraj training every day. He studied at the DAV Public School in Chandigarh.

In 2011, he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor (stage-I) in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment at the Cancer Research Institute in Boston, USA as well as Medicine Facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana.[14][15]Shabnam Singh was with Yuvraj during his diagnosis with a cancerous tumorin his left lung in USA.[16] In March 2012, Yuvraj was discharged from hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April.[17][18]

It is believed that Yograj Singh, Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh's father paid a hefty sum of INR 2,000,000 (USD 36,805) to Nirmal Babaji to get his blessings and make "kirpa" (God's kindness) flow in Yuvraj's life to help him in recovering from mediastinal seminoma cancer.[19] After taking the money, Nirmal Babaji assured that Yuvraj does need any other treatment. Yuvraj's parents kept on waiting for him to recover but the symptoms got worse and his pain increased. Finally feeling let down by Nirmal Babaji, they decided to take Yuvraj to USA for further treatment.[19] In an interview with PTC News Channel, Yograj Singh talked about the money paid to Nirmal Babaji. Shabnam Singh, Yuvraj's mother went on to clarify that Nirmal Babaji had refunded their money after his blessings proved to be ineffective in treating the cancer.[19]

Twenty20 career

On 19 September 2007 against England in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 Super 8 match held at Kingsmead in Durban, he hit 6 Sixes in an over off Stuart Broad. This helped him to reach the fastest fifty ever in a Twenty20 game, off just 12 balls and also the fastest in any form of international cricket.[27][28][29] This was the fourth time that six sixes had been hit in one over in senior cricket, the first time in Twenty20 cricket, and the first time in any form of international cricket against a bowler from a Test playing nation. He has also hit the longest six of the tournament: 119 metres (390 ft) off Australian bowler Brett Lee.[30] Yuvraj was awarded a Porsche 911 for his 6 sixes achievement by the Vice President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Lalit Modi. Yuvraj also received Rs.10,000,000 (US$252,716) in cash from the BCCI for his performance in the tournament.[31] He is also the first Indian player to cross 100 Sixes in Twenty 20 matches.

Yuvraj also scored 70 runs off 30 balls and went on to claim the Man of the Match against Australia in the World Twenty20 semifinals at Durban.[32]
Comeback after lung cancer

After his chemotherapy sessions treating seminoma in Indianapolis, Yuvraj's cancer showing full signs of remission, he aimed at resuming cricket at the World Twenty20.[33] The selectors picked Yuvraj Singh to be a part of the 15-member Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka from September 18, 2012.[34]
He made his comeback against New Zealand in a T20I at Chennai where he scored 34 off 26 balls (1 four, 2 sixes) as his side lost by only 1 run. He started his World Twenty20 campaign with a 3/24 against Afghanistan. He took 1/16 against Australia, 2/16 against Pakistan and a 2/23 against South Africa. He ended up being the highest wicket taker for India in the tournament, though he could not match up to the expectations with his bat.
He got selected to the Test series against England at home, and while preparing for test, he played a single Duleep Trophy match against Central Zone at Hyderabad where he scored 208 off 241 balls (33 fours and 3 sixes) before being caught and bowled by Murali Kartik. Then he also starred in a first class match against England as a member of India A cricket team, where he scored 59 (7 fours and 4 sixes), and took 5/94 at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai.
Style of Play
Yuvraj during fielding practice.

Yuvraj is primarily a left-handed batsman but can bowl part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved in the latter part of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than spin bowling, and cites the Indian Oil Cup 2005 as a turning point in his career.[35] Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at point & covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural strokeplayer with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals & just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a treat to watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. A Cricinfo report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting ODI run outs, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out.[36] He was previously often characterised as having attitude problems,[37] but later often assumed leadership positions during Rahul Dravid's tenure as captain.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India nominated Yuvraj Singh for the Arjuna Award, after his man of the series performance in the 2011 World Cup.[38] Yuvraj's much awaited second innings after 10 month sabbatical was washed out by rain on 8th sep. However he made his entry on 11 September 2012 in the second and final T20 match of the series.
Indian Premier League

He was the icon player and captain for Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kings XI Punjab in the first two seasons; in 2010, the third season, icon player status was abolished and the captaincy given to Kumar Sangakkara. They came second in the round-robin phase of the tournament, but lost their semi-final to the Chennai Super Kings. On 1 May 2009, Yuvraj picked up his first hat-trick in T20 cricket against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Kingsmead in Durban, the same ground where he hit his six sixes. He dismissed Robin Uthappa, Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis. On 17 May 2009, Yuvraj picked up his second Twenty20 hat-trick against Deccan Chargers at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Yuvraj dismissed Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Symonds and Venugopal Rao.

The Pune Warriors were a new team introduced for the 2011 IPL. Yuvraj Singh was bought by the team and chosen as captain.[39] Pune Warriors finished ninth, ahead of only the Delhi Daredevils.[40] From 14 matches, Yuvraj scored 343 runs at an average of 34.30, including two half-centuries.[41] After much controversy BCCI has allowed Pune Warriors to have his replacement for 2012 Indian Premier League, citing his medical condition and nonavailability for 2012 IPL due to the same.[42]
