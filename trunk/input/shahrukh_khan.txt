Early life and background

Khan was born on 2 November 1965 to Muslim parents in New Delhi, India.[24][25] His father, Taj Mohammed Khan, a Pathan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar, British India. According to Khan, his paternal grandfather was originally from Afghanistan.[26] His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the adopted daughter of Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Janjua Rajput clan, who served in the Indian National Army.[27] Khan's father came to New Delhi from Qissa Khawani Bazaar in Peshawar before the partition of India,[28] Regarding his origins, he described himself on Twitter as "half hyderabadi (mom) half Pathan (Dad) some kashmiri (grandmom)"[29] His father died from cancer when Khan was 15 years old, and his mother died in 1990 after prolonged illness.[30][31] Khan was very attached to his parents as a child and describes their early deaths as a turning point in his life and as his biggest motivation for hard work. He explained that his ideology in life is "... to make movies so damn bloody big...that my parents somewhere sit down on a star and from there also can look at their son and say 'I can see his movies from here better than I can see the Wall of China or anything. We see his movies covering the face of this earth'."[32] Khan has an elder sister named Shehnaz.[33]

Growing up in Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi,[34] Khan attended St. Columba's School where he was accomplished in sports, drama, and academics. He won the Sword of Honour, an annual award given to the student who best represents the spirit of the school. Khan later attended the Hansraj College (1985–1988) and earned his Bachelors degree in Economics. When Hansraj College celebrated its 50th anniversary, it gave away 17 shields to its alumni who had excelled in their lives and professions. Khan was one of them. Though he pursued a Masters Degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia, he later opted out to pursue a career in Bollywood.[35] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi.[36]

After the death of his mother, Khan moved to Mumbai in 1991.[37] He married Gauri Chibber, a Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991.[30] They have two children, son Aryan (b. 1997) and daughter Suhana (b. 2000). According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. At home, his children follow both religions, with the Qur'an being situated next to the Hindu deities.[38]

1988–92: Early work and breakthrough

Khan studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John at Delhi's "Theatre Action Group" (TAG).[39] Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, but due to production delays, the 1988 television series, Fauji was his television debut. He played the leading role of Commando Abhimanyu Rai in the critically acclaimed show, which earned him mass recognition.[37][40] He went on to appear in Aziz Mirza's Circus (1989)[41] and played a minor role in the made-for-television English-language film, In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearance in these teleserials, led critics to compare his acting style with that of film actor Dilip Kumar.[42] In 1991, Khan shifted base to Mumbai and received his first film offer with Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai.[37] However, due to production delays, his second film, Deewana (1992), alongside Rishi Kapoor and Divya Bharti released first.[36][43] The film became a box office hit, and launched his career in Bollywood.[44] Despite portraying a supporting character in the film, he won a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award, the following year.

He subsequently featured in Mani Kaul's adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot, Idiot. Originally made for television, the film eventually received a theatrical release and debuted at the New York Film Festival on 8 October 1992.[45] Later that year, he played the titular character in the comedy, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with actress Juhi Chawla. The film proved to be a box office hit.[46] He went on to star in Ketan Mehta's Maya Memsaab, an adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary. Upon release, the film generated controversy in India due to Khan's appearance in an "explicit" sex scene with co-star Deepa Sahi.[47]
1993–97: Critical and commercial success

In 1993, Khan garnered appreciation for portraying negative roles, that of an obsessive lover and a murderer, respectively, in the box office hits, Darr and Baazigar.[48] The "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema" analyzed that "he defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero."[49] Darr marked the first of many collaborations of Khan with film-maker Yash Chopra and his banner Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering in the film and the usage of the phrase, "I love you, Kkkiran," were popular with the audiences.[50] His other release, Baazigar, in which he played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, "shocked the Indian audiences" with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[51] His performance in Baazigar won him his first Filmfare Best Actor Award.

The same year, Khan played the role of a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's dramedy Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, a performance that earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. In a retrospective review by Rediff, Sukanya Verma called it Khan's best performance and added, "He was spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart."[52] Khan, himself, considers this film to the best film that he has acted in.[53] In 1994, Khan once again played an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit. Though the film was a commercial failiure, Khan's performance earned him the Filmfare Best Villain Award.[54]

In 1995, Khan starred in two box-office blockbusters. His first release was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun, in which Khan was a part of an ensemble cast that included Salman Khan, Kajol, Mamta Kulkarni, Raakhee and Amrish Puri. The film, which dealt with the concept of reincarnation, became the second-highest grossing film of the year in India.[55] He followed it with Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. A major critical and commercial success, the film became the year's top-grossing production in India and abroad.[56] The film was declared an "all time blockbuster"; it remains the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema[57] and as of 2011, it is still playing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai.[58] Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge has grossed over INR 1.2 billion worldwide. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, and Khan's performance as a young NRI who falls for Kajol's character while on a trip across Europe won him critical acclaim and his second Best Actor Award at the Filmfare. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the film amongst the 25 Must See Bollywood Films, citing it as a "trendsetter of sorts".[59] Raja Sen reviewed, "Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the junta [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting. "[60]

1996 proved to be a disappointing year for Khan, as he appeared in two critical and commercial failiures, Praveen Nischol's English Babu Desi Mem and Mahesh Bhatt' Chaahat[61] However, in 1997, his starring role in Subhash Ghai's social drama Pardes earned him commercial success. The film, which also featured Mahima Chaudhry and Apurva Agnihotri, saw him portray the role of Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. His performance earned him a nomination for the Best Actor at the Filmfare Award ceremony. He then featured in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy, Yes Boss, opposite Juhi Chawla. Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box-office.[62] His final release of the year was Yash Chopra's blockbuster musical romanance, Dil to Pagal Hai. The project, also featuring Madhuri Dixit and Karishma Kapoor, marked his second collaboration with the filmmaker. Khan essayed the role of Rahul, a stage director who falls in love with one of his new actresses, played by Dixit. The film as well as his performance met with critical appreciation; he won his third Best Actor Award at the Filmfare.[62]
1998–2002: International recognition

In 1998, Khan appeared in three films. His first release was Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy, Duplicate opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre. The film, which saw him portray a double role, marked his first of many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company, Dharma Productions. The film however, failed to do well at the box office.[63] He then won critical praise for his performance in Mani Ratnam's acclaimed Dil Se... The film was the third in Ratnam's trilogy of terror films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, after Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995).[64][65] Khan played the part of Amarkant "Amar" Varma, an All India Radio correspondent, who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist, played by Manisha Koirala.[66] Rediff.com published, "Khan delivers a compelling performance. He plays the part with taut restraint, and expresses exasperation superbly."[67] The film,which failed financially in India, however, emerged as a commercial success overseas,[68] becoming the first Indian film to enter the top 10 at the United Kingdom box office.[69][70]

His final release of the year was Karan Johar's candyfloss romance, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, which paired him with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The film was declared an "all time blockbuster", with a worldwide gross of over INR 1 billion.[71] Khan played the role of Rahul Khanna, a college student, who falls in love with his best friend (Kajol) after the death of his wife (Mukerji), years after breaking contact with her. His performance won him the Best Actor award at the Filmfare ceremony for the second consecutive year. Khan's only release in 1999, Baadshah opposite Twinkle Khanna, was an average grosser, for which he earned a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role.[72] In the same year, Khan set up his own production company, Dreamz Unlimited with actor, Juhi Chawla and director, Aziz Mirza. (see below). In 2000, the three collaborated on their first film, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike and failed to emulate the commercial success of the trio's previous films, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman and Yes Boss.[73]

Khan's next release was Mansoor Khan's action drama Josh. The film starred Khan as the leader of a Christian gang in Goa, with Aishwarya Rai playing his twin sister. The film emerged as a box office success in both India and abroad.[73] Vinayak Chakravorty of Hindustan Times wrote that Khan "basks in his tailormade role, donning with panache the garb of a streetsmart tough. "[74] He next played the role of a Muslim archaeologist, beaten to death during the unrest following the partition of India in Hey Ram. Directed by and co-starring Kamal Hassan, the film was critically acclaimed and was selected as India's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars that year.[75] Additionally, for the Tamil version of the film, Khan dubbed for his own lines.[76] His final release of the year was Aditya Chopra's romantic drama, Mohabbatein, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan. The film was a major financial success, and Khan's performance as a music teacher was acclaimed by critics; Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama mentioned him to be "outstanding as Raj Aryan." He was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.

In 2001, Khan essayed the titular role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic, Asoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of Ashoka the Great.[77] The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response.[78] The film, which also featured Kareena Kapoor received generally positive reviews with Khan receiving favourable reactions for his performance; Rediff concluded that "he puts in a strong performance, in this well defined role."[79]

He next collaborated with Karan Johar again in the family drama, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, in which he featured as a part of an ensemble cast that included Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Kajol, Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan. The film was a major financial success in India and the top-grossing Indian production of all-time in the overseas market until 2006, earning over INR 1.17 billion worldwide.[80] Khan's portrayal of Rahul Raichand, an adopted son of Bachchan's character, who disowns him for marrying a girl belonging to a lower socio-economic group than his family, played by Kajol, met with wide public appreciation. Khan described the character of Rahul by saying, "I love the vulnerability and the honesty in his eyes. He has the appeal of a boy next door. Besides, his intensity and ability to convey emotions without words is amazing."[81] Taran Adarsh reviewed, "Khan sparkles yet again", noting that he performed the part "with amazing poise, class, honesty and maturity".[82] It garnered him another nomination for the Filmfare Best Actor Award. Khan termed Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham as "a turning point in his career".[81]

In 2002, Khan played the titlular role, The role of Devdas in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance, Devdas, which was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time.[83] This was the third Hindi film adaptation of Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name. Featuring opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit, Khan's performance as a rebellious alcoholic was well received and he won yet another Filmfare Best Actor Award. The film surfaced as the highest-grossing film of the year in India and overseas, earning a revenue of INR39 million (US$709,800) domestically.[84][85] Devdas won numerous awards, including 10 Filmfare Awards and received a special screening at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.[86][87] It received a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Language Film as well and was India's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. In an interview with Rediff.com, Khan commented, "We stars live in this bubble where everyone is smiling at you, where everyone loves you. Somehow, you lose touch with real, deep down sadness. Working on this film put us in touch with that emotion. "[36] After the release of the film, Khan took a six months break from acting. He explained that during his break, he "just enjoyed the feeling of being sad". Khan also starred alongside Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan in the family-drama Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam. The film, which took six years to make, due to unending production problems,[88] emerged as an average grosser at the box office.[84]
2003: Spine injury and subsequent surgery

In December 2001, while filming a special appearance for Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power, Khan suffered a spine injury while doing one of the action sequences.[89] He flew to Lucknow a week later for a series of stage shows which led to further aggravation of his condition.[89] By the time he returned to Mumbai, Khan was experiencing severe pain.[89] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc between vertebrae six and seven.[89] Khan is one of the few celebrities worldwide to have had the problem.[90] Hoping to avoid surgery in a bid to not delay his pending projects, and based on his former experience with a failed knee surgery three years earlier, Khan tried multiple alternative therapies from homoeopathy to Reiki but nothing offered a permanent solution.[89] He eventually shot Devdas (2002) and Chalte Chalte (2003) in acute pain and continued with the shoot for Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) until the day he left for London.[89][91] He reached the point where he had doctors and ambulances on standby on the sets.[91]

By the beginning of 2003, Khan's condition severely worsened.[89][92] The slipped disc was eventually touching his nerves which put pressure on his legs and neck.[92] It also presented the risk of paralysis of his arms. In February, Khan was told by doctors that he had to undergo an urgent Anterior Cervical Discectomy.[90][92] The main concern was the possibility of irreparable nerve damage during surgery which would have left him with a permanent weak left side.[93] During his acceptance speech for the Filmfare Best Actor award he received for his performance in Devdas (2002), Khan stated that emotionally he was a bit shaken as he was going in for a surgery that was described by him as a “not a very good thing to go in for. ”[94] The surgery took place on 24 February in Wellington Hospital, London and lasted for one hour – a titanium disc was inserted in his spine and he was discharged after two days.[89]

Khan faced several post-operative problems including hoarseness, weakness, pain and high risk of infection.[89][90] In an interview with Rediff four months after the surgery, he said "I am supposed to be on the road to recovery. For a year, I have to take things easy. I have my good and bad moments. Mornings aren't good. Till about 2 pm, I feel a lot of pain. When I bend down or play with my kids, I get some pain in the neck (...) For now I have to go to London every month for a checkup. "[91] He resumed shooting Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and Main Hoon Na (2004) in June of the same year however, the songs sequences in those films had to be postponed to late October.[95] The injury resulted in Khan cutting down noticeably on work and reducing his number of films per year.[91]
2003–10: Stardom and critical acclaim

In 2003, Khan produced and starred in Aziz Mirza's, Chalte Chalte, a romance dealing with the troubles faced by a married couple, opposite Rani Mukerji.

Khan received unanimous critical appreciation for the portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease. The Hindu noted, "His enthusiasm unbounded, his energy unbridled, Shah Rukh is in form here. And as a guy with a few days to live and a life to spend in a moment, he looks for your sympathy. He reduces many to tears. And with each tear he rises a rank higher in the echelons of actors".[98] The film was a critical and commercial success, becoming the second highest grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in the overseas market that year.[96] When adjusted for inflation its total gross worldwide is INR 1.3 billion.[99] The film earned him another Filmfare Best Actor Award nomination.

2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He produced and starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the action comedy Main Hoon Na alongside Suniel Shetty, Sushmita Sen, Kirron Kher, Amrita Rao and Zayed Khan. Dealing with a fictionalized account of the India–Pakistan relations, the film emerged as a major commercial success.[100] He then played an Indian Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh in Yash Chopra's love saga Veer-Zaara alongside Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta. The film was the biggest hit of 2004 in both India and overseas, with a worldwide gross of over INR 940 million[80][100] and was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical appreciation.[101] Veer-Zaara, which narrated the love story of Singh and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan (Zinta) fetched Khan appreciation with Rama Sharma from The Tribune writing, "Shah Rukh Khan here scales the heights of sensitivity, rising above the mundane. His expressions are mature and reach out to touch the heart of the common man. "[102]

In December 2004, Khan received wide critical acclaim for his performance in Ashutosh Gowariker's social drama, Swades. Also featuring Gayatri Joshi, Swades narrated the story of a NASA scientist who returns to India to get in touch with his roots. Several film critics consider Khan's performance in the film to be his best till date.[11] Critic Jitesh Pillai analyzed, "Ultimately your heart leaps out to the magical Shah Rukh Khan, who unarguably gives his career's finest performance. Shorn of any artifice or nervous energy, his anguish is tangible. He inhabits Mohan Bharghava with consummate ease, you can feel the earnestness of his intentions, the wetness of his tears".[103] Filmfare included his performance in the 2010 issue of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[104] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his releases in 2004, and eventually won the award for Swades.[100] The film itself was featured on Rediff's list of the 10 Best Bollywood Movies of the Decade.[105]

His only release in 2005, Paheli opposite Rani Mukerji, was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was chosen as India’s official entry to the Oscars for the 79th Academy Awards.[106] Despite flopping at the box-office, Paheli was critically acclaimed, as was Khan's performance, which Raja Sen called " A top-notch performance, [That] justifies his supremacy in the film world".[107] The following year, Khan collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time for the adult-drama, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. With an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Kirron Kher, the film told the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, which results in an extramarital affair.

His subsequently essayed the titular role in the action thriller, Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. The film as well as Khan received mixed comments from film critics. His performance was extensively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan, the actor in the original.[109] Taran Adarsh noted that Khan "does very well as Don. He enacts the evil character with flourish. But he fails to carry off the other role [Vijay] with conviction. It looks made up, it doesn't come natural to him at all."[109] While Derek Elley of Variety argued that "it's hard to accept him (Khan) as the title character" and that "Khan is far more convincing as Vijay, playing up to his rom-com fanbase with plenty of boyish humor."[110] The film became the fifth-highest grossing film of the year in India[108] and the highest grossing film of the year in the overseas market. It grossed a total of INR 1.04 billion worldwide.[80] Both Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Don earned him Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare, while the latter earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Asian Film Awards.

In 2007, Khan featured in Yash Raj Films' Chak De! India, a semi-fictional account of the Indian women's national hockey team. Khan stated that he accepted the role of Kabir Khan, the captain of the team, because he liked "the thought of a film whose plot is about women".[111] Additionally, he was a hockey player during his college days and aspired to be a professional hockey player before he suffered a back injury.[112] Khan noted that while this background helped him during the filming, he also felt that the experience of playing again after a long time was "very difficult and different". Khan tore a hamstring three days before the filming was over.[113][114] Chak De!India was a major critical and commercial success in India and abroad.[115] Earning over INR 1.03 billion worldwide,[80] Chak De! India became the third-highest grossing film of 2007 in India and won Khan yet another Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN wrote about his performance, "For the first time since Swades, Shah Rukh plays a role without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks. He sinks his teeth into the part of the determined coach and comes up with such a terrific performance. He's hopeful at times and despondent at others, he's humorous at times, and stern at others. He plays Kabir Khan like a real flesh-and-blood human being. "[116] Filmfare also included his performance in the 2010 issue of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[12]

In the same year, Khan starred in Farah Khan's second film, Om Shanti Om alongside Deepika Padukone, Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal. In the re-incarnation melodrama, Khan essayed the role of Om Prakash Makhija, a junior artiste from the 1970s who is reborn in the 2000s as a superstar named Om Kapoor. His performance was generally well received by critics; Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, "[T]he enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style – spontaneous and intuitively intelligent. "[117] The film emerged as the year's highest grossing motion picture in India and the overseas market with a worldwide gross of over INR1.48 billion.[118] Om Shanti Om earned him another nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony.

Khan played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with a low self-esteem, whose love for his accidental wife (Sharma), causes him to transform himself into the loud and fun-loving alter-ego of Raj. The film received mixed reviews from film critics, but was declared a blockbuster at the box-office.[119] His performance was appreciated by critics, with Rachel Saltz of The New York Times writing, "The Surinder/Raj dual role seems tailor-made (probably was) for Mr. Khan, who gets to show off his twin talents: he suffers nobly and entertains with panache. "[120] It earned him yet another nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. In December of the same year, Khan suffered a serious shoulder injury while filming for a cameo role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He subsequently underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time, but due to immense pain that left him almost immobile, he had to undergo an arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[121][122]

Khan spent several months researching by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected with the disorder in an effort to portray the character of Rizwan Khan.[125] In an interview with Hindustan Times he said, "Whenever you're dealing with a disorder or a near atypical situation, the first thought is that the sort of parameters you have to set that in no which way you are derogatory or deriding the disorder. The second part is you have to come as close to reality in depicting that characterization and so one had to study a lot and one does get worried"[126] Upon release, My Name is Khan received positive reviews from critics and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all-time in the overseas market. Khan's performance in the film was appreciated by most critics with Jay Wesissberg from Variety reviewing, "Khan uses the mannerisms associated with Asperger's – averted eyes, springy steps, stuttered repetitions of memorized texts – yet captures the personality beneath the condition in a standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval. "[127] My Name is Khan fetched Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, thereby sharing the record with actor Dilip Kumar.

This was a totally different kind of acting from we had ever seen – visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[263] He was also praised for being a risk taker by "pushing the envelope" playing characters that were considered taboo at the time.[262][263] Khan was credited for changing the image of the typical conventional Indian hero; being one of the pioneers of returning the romantic boyish character to the Indian screen.[262][263] Harish Dugh from The Indian Express noted: "The die was cast when [King] Khan replaced the Bachchan bravado with the portrayal of a very humane and likeable, simple and feeling young man." and added: "Welcome to a new-look Bollywood. Today, it stands virtually transformed by SRK single-handedly into an entity that caters to people's desire to see their superstar reflect their own weaknesses, pain and anguish."[262]

With the release of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995), Khan began his long lasting foray into the romantic genre which will continue with numerous films such as Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Devdas (2002), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012).[263][264] Due to his appearance in these films, he has developed a "romantic lover" image and has been often tagged as an icon of romance in Hindi cinema.[258][264] An image that has been met with polarizing reactions; while some argue that he "became trapped in the conventional romantic lover-boy image, continuing to essay, over the years, a series of roles that were mind-numbingly alike"[263] others debate that "it is the romantic SRK that |I] connect with the most" and that he "plays the romantic man with such pizzazz and in the old-world style that he is treat to watch, as he woos the hearts of his co-stars and his audience!".[265] Anupama Chopra further noted: "You have to admire his ability to play the romantic hero. We've seen him do it for two decades but he still makes it compelling."[266]

Following his portrayal of such characters as those in Dil Se.. (1998), Swades (2004), Chak De! India (2007) and My Name Is Khan (2010) and Don 2 (2011), Khan was recognized for his versatility.[258][262] In 2010, Filmfare Magazine included two of his performances—from Swades and Chak De! India—in its list of "80 Iconic Performances". The Indian Express noted: [Khan] has tailored and leveraged his acting skills in such a versatile manner as to impress a demanding audience world-over with his ability to change his acting in a manner unforeseen in the annals of Indian cinema."[262]
