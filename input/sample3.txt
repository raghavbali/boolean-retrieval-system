Anil Kumble (About this sound pronunciation (help·info); born 17 October 1970) is a former international cricketer and captain of the Indian cricket team. A right-arm leg spin (leg break googly) bowler, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and remains the third-highest wicket taker—only behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne—as of 2012. Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, rather relied much on pace and accuracy. His ability to make the ball bounce with subtle variations in pace made him a tough bowler to face for the batsmen; thus earning him the Sobriquet "Jumbo". Kumble was selected as the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1993 and one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year three years later.

Born in Bangalore, Karnataka, Kumble developed an early interest in cricket as he grew up watching players like Bill O'Reilly and B. S. Chandrasekhar before becoming a full-fledged cricketer. He made his First-class debut at the age of 19 while representing Karnataka. Soon he was picked up for the Austral-Asia Cup in 1990 before making his Test debut against England later that year. Since then he has represented the Indian Test team on more than 132 Test matches and was mainly responsible for India's victory. Kumble became a part of the regular ODI team during the early 1990s and held some of the best performances during this time; which included his six for 12 (six wickets for 12 runs) against the West Indies. The year 1996 proved to very successful for him as he was selected for the World Cup and emerged out as the most successful bowler of the tournament; he played seven matches and captured 15 wickets at an average of 18.73. In 1999 while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all the ten batsmen in a Test match innings.[1] In the event he became the second player to achieve this feat after Jim Laker of England.[2][3]

Kumble was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour in 2005. After having played for 18 years, he announced his retirement from international cricket in November 2008. In October 2012, Kumble was appointed the chairman of International Cricket Council (ICC)'s cricket committee.[4]

In January 2013, Kumble accepted the role of Chief Mentor with the Mumbai Indians, resigning from a similar position he held in the Royal Challengers Bangalore.[5]

It was during the 1992 Indian tour of South Africa that he established himself as a quality spinner, taking eight wickets in the second Test. All in all he took 18 wickets at an average of 25.94 and with an economy rate of 1.84 in the four test series.[18] Later that year, when England toured India, Kumble took 21 wickets in three Tests at an average of 19.8.[19] He picked up seven wickets for 165 runs in the third Test of the series played at Mumbai as India went on to win the match by an innings and 15 runs.[20] He was adjudged man of the match for his performance.[21]

Kumble took his first 50 Test wickets in 10 matches; the record remained the fastest by an Indian bowler till Ravichandran Ashwin surpassed him achieving the feat in nine matches. His 100 Test wickets in 21 Test matches, the second fastest by an Indian bowler[22] after Erapalli Prasanna. On 27 November 1993, he took six wickets for 12 runs in an ODI against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, Calcutta in the final of the Hero Cup, which still remains an Indian record.[23][24] In January 1994, when Sri Lanka toured India Kumble picked up his first 10 wicket haul in his 14th match which ensured India's victory by an innings and 119 runs.

For more details on this topic, see 1996 Cricket World Cup.

The year 1996 proved to be extremely successful for Kumble as he claimed 61 ODI wickets at an average of 20.24.[30] All in all, he was the leading wicket taker in the calendar year with 90 wickets at an average of 24.14 in Tests and ODIs combined.[31] Kumble was selected in the Indian side for the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

Setting records and rise through the ranks

In February 1997 India visited the West Indies for a series of five tests and four ODIs.[38] Kumble was part of the squad and he was the leading wicket-taker in the Test series. He picked up 19 wickets, averaging 30.31 with the ball.[39] Kumble was the leading wicket taker by a large margin when Australia visited India for Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 1998. He picked up 23 wickets in 3 test matches at the average of 18.26.[40]

Kumble is one of only two bowlers ever (the only other being Jim Laker of England in 1956) to have taken all ten wickets in a Test innings, taking 10 for 74. Kumble achieved this against Pakistan in the second Test played in Delhi in February 1999.[41] Although by failing to dismiss Pakistan's Waqar Younis in either innings, he missed out on the achievement of dismissing all eleven batsmen in a Test match. It has been said that once he had got nine wickets his friend and teammate Javagal Srinath started bowling wide off stumps, and was called twice, so that Kumble could take the 10th.[42] The performance was rated by Wisden as the second best "Bowling performance of all time".[43] The achievement was commemorated by naming a traffic circle in Bangalore after him.[44] In 1999 he was the third highest wicket taker with 88 wickets at the average of 30.03 behind Glenn Mcgrath and Shane Warne.[31]

when the Indian opener Sadagoppan Ramesh tried to take a catch off some other Pakistani player …he was causioned by Javagal Srinath not to try and take any catch just because Anil Kumble should take all 10 Wickets. This was revealed by S.Ramesh in an interview via 10 Sports; about the particular match “Anil Kumble’s 10 wickets against Pakistan at Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi in 1999″.When Kumble was looking to take his tenth wicket in the India-Pakistan test in 1999, Srinath, who was bowling from the other end, was trying to bowl way outside the off stump to avoid taking the final wicket in order for Kumble to get to the record. Anil Kumble always gives full credit to him for his perfect 10 against Pakistan as Srinath bowled consecutive wide balls in test match to avoid taking wicket

On 6 October 2004, Kumble became only the third spinner in the history of Test cricket after Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan and the second Indian bowler after Kapil Dev to capture 400 Test wickets.[45] Reaching the mark took him 30 fewer Test matches than it took Kapil Dev, and 7 fewer than Warne. In the India-West Indies series of 2006, Kumble took 6–78 in the second innings of the final Test in Sabina Park, Jamaica, and bowled India to a historic series win; it had been 35 years since a similar series victory. During the first innings of the match, Kumble scored 45 and became the second player in the history of the game after Shane Warne to score 2000 runs and take over 500 Test wickets. Kumble also holds the world record for trapping most batsmen leg before wicket.[46] On 10 December 2004, Kumble became India's highest wicket taker when he trapped Mohammad Rafique of Bangladesh to surpass Kapil Dev's haul of 434 wickets.

On 10 August 2007, Kumble scored his maiden century, with an innings of 110 not out against England to help them finish with 664. He took 118 Test matches to reach his maiden Test hundred, which is a record for taking the most number of matches to score a century, beating Chaminda Vaas who had held this record previously with 96 Tests. It was also the only hundred by an Indian in the 3 Test series.[50] He is the only Test cricketer to have taken all ten wickets in an innings and score a Test hundred in his career. A day after scoring his ton, Kumble dismissed Vaughan for his 900th International wicket and 563rd Test wicket, drawing him level with McGrath. Later he trapped Monty Panesar for an LBW to finish the innings and overtake McGrath in the list of all time wicket takers,[51] only Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne have more wickets.

Retirement from International cricket

Kumble injured the little finger of his left hand while attempting a catch off Matthew Hayden in Australia's first innings which rendered him unfit for the 4th and final test of the series against Australia in November 2008.[57] Kumble was finding it difficult to find his striking form and went wicketless in four consecutive innings before the first innings of Australia in the third test of the series against Australia in which he managed three lower order wickets. He declared the 2nd innings of India with only 6 overs of play left in the drawn match. His final figures were 4–0–14–0.

Style and technique
Test career batting performance of Anil Kumble.

Kumble is a right-arm leg spinner (legbreak googly) with an unorthodox style, most famous for his flipper.[71] and a right-hand batsman[72] He started his career as a fast bowler,[73] which gave him a useful faster delivery. His unique bowling style can be attributed to matting pitches in Bangalore which assist top-spin and over-spin.[74]

Kumble is one of the 4 bowlers, alongside Richard Hadlee, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, and the only Indian bowler ever, to have taken 5 wickets in a Test innings more than 30 times.[75] He also holds the world record for the largest number of caught-and-bowled dismissals in tests, 35 – which forms 5.65% of his total wickets.[76] He is also one of 4 Indian bowlers to have conceded over 250 runs in a Test match, although he took 12 wickets in that match.[77] He is known for bowling tirelessly, having bowled 72 overs in a Test innings once.[78] He is also remembered for his tenacity in bowling even when injured, especially after an incident in a match against West Indies where, despite having his broken jaw being heavily taped, he came back and took the wicket of Brian Lara.[79]

Kumble relies more on accuracy, variations and bounce rather than spinning the ball.[7] Sambit Bal, the editor of Cricinfo, writes:[56] "That he [Kumble] has been an unusual spinner has been said many times before. It has also been said, a trifle unfairly, that he is a unidimensional bowler. Palpably, he has lacked the turn of Warne and Murali, but his variety has been subtler, far more apparent to batsmen than to viewers. He has shown that not only turn and flight that can deceive the batsman but also the changes of length and pace. He has been a cultured practitioner of his unique craft and a master of nuances."
Involvement in cricket associations

Kumble has been appointed to the athlete's commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with his term starting on 1 January 2009.[80]

On 21 November 2010, Kumble was elected as The President of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, with statemates and former India teammate Venkatesh Prasad elected as Vice-President whereas his former teammate, Javagal Srinath got elected as Secretary.[81]
