The Indian rupee (sign: ₹; code: INR; हिंदी: रुपया) is the official currency of the Republic of India. The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India.[1]
The modern rupee is subdivided into 100 paise (singular paisa), though as of 2011 only 50-paise coins are legal tender.[2][3] Banknotes are available in nominal values of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 rupees. Rupee coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 100 and 1000; of these, the INR 100 and INR 1000 coins are for commemorative purposes only; the only other rupee coin has a nominal value of 50 paise, since lower denominations have been officially withdrawn.
