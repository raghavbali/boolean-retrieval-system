The pound sterling (symbol: Â£; ISO code: GBP), commonly known simply as the pound, is the official currency of the United Kingdom, the British Crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, the British Overseas Territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,[6] the British Antarctic Territory[7] and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (in Tristan da Cunha only).[8] It is subdivided into 100 pence (singular: penny). A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the "pound".
